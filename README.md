### Hi  ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, a senior `Golang` | `Nodejs` backend engineer currently looking for a new position. Find [me on LinkedIn ðŸ”—](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophe-hartwig-ba228a5/).

Here are a few open source projects of mine:

- [TLSProxy](https://github.com/chrisDeFouRire/tlsproxy) is an easy to use SSL/TLS proxy. Use it to put an HTTPS proxy in front of a docker service super easily, with automatic LetsEncrypt certificate
- [Dojibar](https://github.com/chrisDeFouRire/dojibar) is a Telegram bot to receive notifications when your Binance stop or limit orders are executed
- [bmerch](https://github.com/chrisDeFouRire/bmerch) is a Binance Merchant API Javascript client. Accept crypto payments easily!
- [gogitsemver](https://github.com/chrisDeFouRire/go-git-semver) makes it easier to follow semantic versioning for your Git projects. Inspired by `npm version`, you can use `git semver patch|minor|major`.

In the past, I've also worked on:

- [Geeo](https://github.com/GeeoIO), a reactive geo database written in Go and clients for JS and Unity
- [Xtralife](https://github.com/xtralifecloud), an open source gaming backend-as-a-service (BaaS)
