### Hi  ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, the founder of [SSLBoard](https://sslboard.com) and before that SSLPing.com (now defunct). Find [me on LinkedIn ðŸ”—](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophe-hartwig-ba228a5/).

At the moment I'm all about SSL Certificates and using Certificate Transparency to provide my customers with actionable insight. If you've ever felt lost with your certificates, that's what I'm working on.

Here are a few open source projects of mine:

- [TLSProxy](https://github.com/chrisDeFouRire/tlsproxy) is an easy to use SSL/TLS proxy. Use it to put an HTTPS proxy in front of a docker service super easily, with automatic LetsEncrypt certificate
- [gogitsemver](https://github.com/chrisDeFouRire/go-git-semver) makes it easier to follow semantic versioning for your Git projects. Inspired by `npm version`, you can use `git semver patch|minor|major`.
